This is a prototype of a remote MCP sever, acting as a middleware to the upstream Sentry API provider.

It is based on [Cloudflare's work towards remote MCPs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/).

## Getting Started

You'll find everything you need to know by visiting the deployed service in production:

<https://mcp.sentry.dev> 

If you're looking to contribute, learn how it works, or to run this for self-hosted Sentry, continue below..

### Stdio vs Remote

While this repository is focused on acting as an MCP service, we also support a `stdio` transport. This is still a work in progress, but is the easiest way to adapt run the MCP against a self-hosted Sentry install.

To utilize the `stdoio` transport, you'll need to create an User Auth Token in Sentry with the necessary scopes. As of writing this is:

```
org:read
project:read
project:write
team:read
team:write
event:read
```

Launch the transport:

```shell
npx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=sentry-user-token --host=sentry.example.com
```

Note: You can also use environment variables:

```shell
SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN=
SENTRY_HOST=
```

### MCP Inspector

MCP includes an [Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector), to easily test the service:

```shell
pnpm inspector
```

Enter the MCP server URL (http://localhost:5173) and hit connect. This should trigger the authentication flow for you.

Note: If you have issues with your OAuth flow when accessing the inspector on `127.0.0.1`, try using `localhost` instead by visiting `http://localhost:6274`.

## Local Development

To contribute changes against the server, you'll need to set things up in in local development. This will require you to create another OAuth App in Sentry (Settings => API => [Applications](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/applications/)):

- For the Homepage URL, specify `http://localhost:5173`
- For the Authorized Redirect URIs, specify `http://localhost:5173/callback`
- Note your Client ID and generate a Client secret.
- Create a `.dev.vars` file in `packages/mcp-cloudflare/` root with:

```shell
# packages/mcp-cloudflare/.dev.vars
SENTRY_CLIENT_ID=your_development_sentry_client_id
SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_development_sentry_client_secret
COOKIE_SECRET=my-super-secret-cookie
```

### Verify

Run the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:5173`

```shell
pnpm dev
```

To test the local server, enter `http://localhost:5173/mcp` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to "List Tools".

### Tests

There are two test suites included: basic unit tests, and some evaluations.

Unit tests can be run using:

```shell
pnpm test
```

Evals will require a `.env` file with some config:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Once thats done you can run them using:

```shell
pnpm test
```
